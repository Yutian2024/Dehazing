# Dehazing
Digital Image Processing application on dehazing.

## Abstract
Nowadays, fog and hazy weathers happen from time to time due to the accompanied environmental pollution caused by the development of modern society. Under these circumstances, floating particles greatly absorb and scatter light and result in low visibility and contrast. In order to avoid the threat for computer vision and some other technologies which depend greatly on image capture, different types of image dehazing algorithms are created. As a key member of image restoration methods, Dark Channel Prior stands out for its low complexity and satisfactory effect. Some specific analysis and implementation with MATLAB about it will be covered.
